# AMTEA-Based-Multi-task-Optimisation-for-Multi-objective-Feature-Selection-in-Classification
This is the source of the EvoStar 2023 conference paper 'AMTEA-Based Multi-task Optimisation for Multi-objective Feature Selection in Classification'. This method addresses multiple related feature selection tasks simultaneously and shares knowledge across them, which improves feature selection performance. The paper can be found at https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/978-3-031-30229-9_40.

wine_mto.py is the main file running the proposed algorithm on the wine datasets.
Then, the experimental results are stored in .../wine/multi/
Results of single-task optimisation on the wine datasets are stored in .../wine/source/
train_hv_statistic_table.py, test_hv_statistic_table.py, comp_time_statistic.py are used for analyzing the experimental results.
