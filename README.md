# AMTEA-Based-Multi-task-Optimisation-for-Multi-objective-Feature-Selection-in-Classification
This repository contains code for reproducing the experiments in the paper "AMTEA-Based Multi-task Optimisation for Multi-objective Feature Selection in Classification" by Jiabin Lin, Qi Chen, Bing Xue, and Mengjie Zhang.

# How to run the experiments

* wine_mto.py is the main file of running the proposed algorithm on the wine datasets.
* The experimental results are stored in .../wine/multi/
* Results of single-task optimisation on the wine datasets are stored in .../wine/source/
* train_hv_statistic_table.py, test_hv_statistic_table.py, comp_time_statistic.py are used for analyzing the experimental results.
